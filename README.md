## Guide to install the application

Blockchain-based Loyalty and Rewards Program using Fungible Tokens" is a loyalty and rewards system implemented using blockchain technology. Instead of traditional loyalty programs that might involve physical cards or centralized databases, this approach leverages the security and transparency of blockchain. Fungible tokens are used as the rewards mechanism. Each customer's loyalty and engagement can be tracked on the blockchain, and as they accumulate points or rewards, these are represented as fungible tokens in the blockchain system.
